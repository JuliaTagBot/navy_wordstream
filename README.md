# About

This is a work-in-progress experiment looking at
[auditory streaming](http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n10/fig_tab/nrn3565_F3.html)
in word and non-word utterances, and the role recent acoustical context may (or
may not) play for these stimuli. The work builds on the findings in:

Billig, A. J., Davis, M. H., Deeks, J. M., Monstrey, J., & Carlyon, R. P. (2013). Lexical Influences on Auditory Streaming. Current Biology, 23(16), 1585â€“1589. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.06.042

# Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/haberdashPI/navy_wordstream/archive/master.zip)
   and unzip this project.
2. Install the 64-bit version of
   [julia](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia/Getting_started)
   (make sure julia is in your `PATH`)
3. Run setup.jl

This last step is accomplished by entering the following commands in a terminal.

```console
$ cd "[download-location]"
$ julia setup.jl
```

Replace `[download-location]` with the directory where you unziped this project.

# Running

To run the experiment just call julia from the terminal as follows:

```console
$ cd "[download-location]"
$ julia run_wordstream.jl [sid]
```

Replace `[sid]` with a subject id number. Results will be saved in a `data` subdirectory.

## Restarting the experiment

If the experiment gets interrupted, the program will report an offset
number. This number is also saved on each line of the data recorded during
the experiment. You can use this number as a second argument to run_wordstream.jl,
and the experiment will start at the beginning of the trial it was interrupted
on.

In the below example, the experiment was terminated for participant 1234 at
offset 20, and the experiment is then resumed with the second command.

```console
$ julia run_wordstream.jl 1234
INFO: Experiment terminated at offset 20.
$ julia run_wordstream.jl 1234 20
```
